As you know, I thought The Martian was a top night out.
He did eat potatoes grown in "human waste".
I thought he wasn't going to make it in the last bit.
I was on the edge of my seat, and I think screaming was involved.
Science was the hero, but no one really plugs a laptop into a supercomputer the way it was in the 
movie.
I would like to consider Venus as a base.
Mars is a big red planet - added.
